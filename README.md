12th Openclassroom project : Develop an analytics dashboard with React

## 1. Project

### 2.1 Prerequisites
- NodeJS
- Npm or Yarn
  
### 2.2 Launching the project
   
- Fork the repository
- Clone it on your computer
- The "npm install" or the "yarn" command will allow you to install the dependencies.

   The "npm start" or the "yarn dev" command from the "P9-front-end-dashboard" folder will allow you to run the micro API - The API is running on the port 3000 (http://localhost:3000)

   The same command from the base repository will allow you to display the dashboard in your default navigator - Warning, you'll need to accept to run the app on a different port from your terminal (the default port 3000 is already used by the micro API)

## 2. Endpoint

### 4.1 Endpoint
   
   To display the dashboard, you'll need to use the following endpoint :
   http://localhost:3001/user/${userId} - Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.
   
### 4.2 Example of query
   
   http://localhost:3001/user/18 - Retrieves user 18's main information.
